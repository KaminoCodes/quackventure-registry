# Quackventure Registry Installation Program

This program installs the required registry entries for [Quackventure](https://hotcocoastudios.itch.io/quackventure). It is designed to facilitate easier file management and editing from the context menu in File Explorer on Windows systems.

## Purpose

'Quackventure' does not require this program to run, but it enhances user experience by allowing .quack files to be played or edited directly from the files' context menu in Explorer.

## Administrator Privileges

Please note that this program requires administrator privileges to run. These elevated privileges are necessary to edit the registry entries.

## Platform Support

Currently, this program is compatible only with Windows operating systems. I am actively working on developing a Unix version to expand platform support.

## Unix Version Development

I am currently unfamiliar with Unix systematics, so developing the Unix version may take some time as I learn and adapt this software to Unix environments.
